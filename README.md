# FiniteDifferencePDE
We can use the finite Difference PDE to evaluate an option price.

Firstly, we need to prove a PDE formula based on black scholes.
Secondly, we can use this formula and the finite difference method to estimate the option price step by step.
Thirdly, we implement this algorithm in python.

You can modify the parameters by yourself and see different output.
