# FiniteDifferencePDE
We can use the finite Difference PDE to evaluate an option price.

You can simply call the function named calculate_prices_explicit or calculate_prices_implicit or calculate_prices_crank by giving all the necessary parameters. (No default parameters given)

You can modify the parameters by yourself and see different new plots as well.
